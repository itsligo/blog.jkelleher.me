# Water Monitoring & Metering CRM

![](http://www.appsolo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ogham.png)Delighted to post an update on some interesting work being undertaken on behalf of [Ogham Engineering Ltd.](http://www.oghamengineering.ie). Ogham were looking for a multi-faceted management system to permit both managers and tenants access to up to the minute water consumption and metering data. The system will provide Ogham with the ability to integrate with their own in-house wireless water monitoring technology. Data is gathered from these sensors unobtrusively installed to water pipes about the building. The data is hosted in the cloud and retrieved by this application. This happens at very regular intervals offering strict control on consumption patterns and helping to identify leaks and mis-use. Our application provides an interface to these meter readings. It also allows Ogham to keep tabs on their customers and tenants to ensure that data is limited only to those concerned. Given the significant customer-facing aspect to this product, a highly intuitive and yet information rich front-end was required. We turned to a now well-established Microsoft development stack - ASP.NET MVC - to provide the breadth of features needed. This coupled with extensive use of Javascript, jQuery and associated libraries, frameworks and plugins offers a very comprehensive package that serves the needs of our client well.
