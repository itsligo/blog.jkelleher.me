#Using Git for classroom assessment

I've been using Git in-class for a few years now and have always been interested in extending it further in the assessment space. Though in-class assessment has the appeal of greater confidence in the originality of the work, it's an artificial space for assessing coding. [Github](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) have recently offered a simple mechanism to handle assessment from students. In using it, students get to work with industry standard tooling and the lecturer has the added benefit of improved insight into how the submission was built - commit by commit.

So, this [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org) presentation takes you quickly through how this worked out.
