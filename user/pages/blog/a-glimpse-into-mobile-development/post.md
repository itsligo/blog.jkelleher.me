![](http://images.trustedreviews.com/images/article/inline/12770-startscreenweb.jpg)One question that (amazingly) wasn’t asked at the [launch](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/2010/02/microsoft-launches-windows-phone-7.html) (actually, more of a teaser) earlier this week of Microsoft Windows [Phone](http://lifehacker.com/5472234/remains-of-the-day-windows-phone-7-looks-great-the-video-edition) 7 Series was the development platform. The phone OS is a major piece of work and shows considerable intent on MS’s behalf so the answer to this question matters – certainly so if your business is software development.

The mobile phone market is [big](http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=985912). Well over a billion phones are sold each year and it looks like the recession there is [over](http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-10445095-266.html). Smartphones sales are up [39%](http://www.insidehw.com/News/Gadgets/Smartphone-sales-up-39-on-year-in-Q4.html) year-on-year in Q4 2009, coming in at 174m units. And what with all the publicity about Apple, it’s worth reminding everyone that Nokia rules the roost in both markets. Nokia’s share of the smartphone market is over 38%, double that of RIM (Research in Motion – think, Blackberry) and well out in front of Apple (iPhone) on 16% (these being Q42009 data). Yes, Apple’s share is growing (doubling last year) but it’s a big pie.

So, MS’s surprise announcement last week reminding everyone that software is key – the hardware is invariably farmed out (whoever heard of [HTC](http://gdgt.com/htc/google/nexus-one/) before Google’s Nexus One?). And there’s a lot of curious .NET/Silverlight/XNA programmers out there willing to enter the mobile market. Thanks to some ‘leaked’ (is anything _really_ leaked anymore?) [documents](http://wmpoweruser.com/?p=13486), it seems the dev platform (drum roll, please) is two-fold: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and Expression Blend with .NET/Silverlight _and_ XNA. Now that’s an interesting new (and well, big) marketplace that has just opened up. It certainly provides a real alternative to Objective-C from Apple.
