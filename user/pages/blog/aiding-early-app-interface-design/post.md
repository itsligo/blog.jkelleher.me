Having just finished another round of interim student project presentations, a common issue that arose was the lack of early design. Putting to one side the usual need to establish the needs of the user, the task coverage etc., the problem of communicating ideas and designs to clients (be they external or the student themselves) was clear as were the consequences of not doing so.

Clearly the pre-requisite for a stab at interface design is the establishment of bounds on the objectives of the system – what makes the cut in terms of features. Clients love to treat this with great fluidity and relish the freedom this brings. It reminds me of the chat I had with a builder who, having reached a certain stage of development, wallowed in the glow of ‘overrun costs’ when I inquired about ‘adding a bit here’ or ‘moving a wall there’. These savvy operators know the game.

Very few of the students we saw actually took the time to explore the design space with their client through the medium of even pen and paper. This is understandable given the ‘can do’ nature of the technology we teach and the minimal downside of doing so in itty-bitty programs. However, scale this up to a larger app or bring in a client (who has real demands – and expectations) and the ‘rush to code’ approach quickly results in misguided designs.

I don’t blame the students wholly here. We need to teach early design techniques – interviews, contextual inquiry, wire-framing, storyboarding, lo-fi prototyping tools. However, it a tough sell when to fully appreciate the need for such skills only comes when you scale up – and there’s little opportunity to do large-scale development. However, the techniques themselves are relatively simple and nowadays are better supported by light-weight tools.

[SketchFlow](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/SketchFlow_OverView.aspx) (part of Expression Suite) from Microsoft is one such tool and does a reasonable job (though Expression Blend) to help prototype an emerging design.

[Mocking Bird](http://gomockingbird.com/) is one of many _online_ tools to let designers explore mockups of future plans _before _committing resources. No matter how adept we might feel we are with our chosen weapons (ASPX, PHP, Flash), they’re development platforms and not design tools.

![Smashing Magazine logo design](http://www.logodesignlove.com/images/blogs/smashing-magazine-logo.gif)[Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/01/35-excellent-wireframing-resources/), a stalwart of good design practice, has a (all you can eat) list of wireframing resources.

Or for a more basic option and for me the tool of choice: pencil and paper. It’s cheap, always to hand and when coupled with proper paper, can be a valuable tool. [GeekChix.org](http://www.geekchix.org/blog/2010/01/03/a-collection-of-printable-sketch-templates-and-sketch-books-for-wireframing/) has a useful list of links to such sketch templates to help frame your designs. Ranging from [iPhone](http://www.uistencils.com/iphone-sketch-pad.html) templates to browsers and the highly-regarded [960-grid](http://960.gs/) system, there should be a stack of this paper on every designers desk – for when inspiration strikes!
