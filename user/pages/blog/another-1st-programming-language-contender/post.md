![small basic](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SjjYQJPW80I/AAAAAAAAEbA/kKgXr76Mn94/smallbasic23.png?imgmax=800)So, the old debate – what is the best first programming language to expose CS1 to? Heck, I remember when it was Pascal and C had to be handled with care. Then I think we took a wrong turn. As is often the case, the pendulum swung too far the other way and we got [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), [Alice](http://www.alice.org/), and (though she’s cute as pie) [Kodu](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/).

![kodu](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SjjYQpROhcI/AAAAAAAAEbE/wlATulpNb2Q/kodu6.jpg?imgmax=800)Now I like Kodu especially but Randy Pausch’s [work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) on Alice is commendable. But I think within the limited confines of CS1 they perhaps represent a luxury that isn’t affordable. By year one end, the students need to have plenty exposure to _real_ programming – real loops, branching etc. – and not graphically simulated alternatives. I think they abstract away too much ![alice_logo](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SjjYQ38vBuI/AAAAAAAAEbI/_3lKqb8KuvM/alice_logo3.jpg?imgmax=800)but they’re definitely of use at 2nd level to light the fire of interest.

So consider [SmallBasic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950524.aspx). I like it for a few reasons:

* It’s probably the safest IDE I’ve seen.
* It’s built on .NET so if you’re leading there, it’s a great fit.
* It’s peppered with help, guidance and intellisense.
* ![scratch](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SjjYRik-sOI/AAAAAAAAEbM/0NAcBftv-0o/scratch%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800)It demands syntax – but again a consistent dot notation that’s common to most newer languages.
* It comes with a decent ‘Getting Started’ guide – I don’t think anyone is going to teach this for longer than a semester.
* You can do graphical stuff, connect to Flickr, make simple games, handle interaction, do turtle-play a la Logo.
* It’s small and free

Programming is always a new frontier for CS1 but wrapping our students in the comfort blanket that is Alice et al, might just be too remote from real programming to help.

**[Jimmiebond](#8 "2009-06-17 20:52:08"):** I had a look at it there, and it seems fine in that its very simple and straight forward to use. But would the fact that it lets users away with errors like leaving out semi-colon and not needing to declare variable type and so on not lead to more confusion when beginners try to use proper code editors like VS, which wont allow those errors, and amplify the confusion that surrounds the simple

**[John Kelleher](#9 "2009-06-21 18:19:35"):** It's the perennial debate. I'm always tempted to do as you say - go straight for the juggler with VS and learn 'right' from the start. I still think this could work but for noobs, you would need *very* carefully crafted exercises and with things changing so much, there isn't that much time to be so methodical about such things.
There's a strong momentum right now for
