One of the problems with being the resident computer geek is that whenever something that needs doing that’s vaguely connected with IT, you’re the guy in the frame. This time round I volunteered to help out with some publicity for a good friend, promoting her childcare business (**Child’s World** at Tonaphubble Lane, Sligo – blatant, but well-deserved plug).

There is serious competition (yes, even in Ireland) for print work right now. I chose [Print24](http://print24.com/ie/) out of Germany. Bottom line, I got an excellent result, better than expected, in the time quoted (exactly – German, naturally) and for _much less_ than their competitors. There’s freefone support, online chat, and a reasonable degree of hand-holding through the ordering process.

For the geeks out there, I used Photoshop [CS4](http://www.studica.com/products/product_detail.cfm?productid=58370&storeid=4&gclid=CLXTybT3nKACFSIslAodd2Djeg) mostly. It’s been a while since I played with Photoshop so found the path creation tricky. I briefly dropped into MS [Expression Design](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/design_overview.aspx) to help out – surprisingly easy – and brought the paths to Photoshop. The stock images came from [stock.xchng](http://www.sxc.hu/) which gave me plenty of pixels to play with (I was using 300dpi for press) though the choice wasn’t as wide as I recall it being. I seriously considered [iStockPhoto](http://www.istockphoto.com/index.php) which thankfully have gotten a lot cheaper of late, though still up to €10 an image – huge range of quality images/illustrations/video though.

It’s always worth hunting for the right typeface though thankfully here, there are plenty free ones that will work. I even found MS Clipart [Library](http://office.microsoft.com/EN-US/CLIPART/DEFAULT.ASPX) a great help – perfect for the ‘red apple/world’ vector graphic above Child’s World, followed up with some Photoshop colour shifting.

I think I’ll be sticking with the day job though – this took about 7 hours end-to-end. I did say it was a freebie, right?
