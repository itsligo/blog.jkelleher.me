Peter Blois and Christian Schorman

Peter ran through a thorough deep dive using Blend 4 beta and a Windows Phone app, a pinball game. He spoke about the benefit of focusing on the visuals without getting stuck with code implementations. The gameplay programming took half day and a few hours per screen design. The phone emulator seems excellent and a totally viable alternative to the actual physical device – that’s good considering that they’re all still in hardware prototype.

Christian re-iterated the real tangible benefits for designers to consume the data from the programmers. We saw this earlier where prototypes were thrown together quickly just by integrating with view-models – Blend surfaces the inherent data seamlessly.
