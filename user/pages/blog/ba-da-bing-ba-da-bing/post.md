Looks like Microsoft are taking the search business ever more serious. Having just launched Bing, [Balmer](http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2009/06/19/ballmer-prepared-to-spend-225-billion-per-year-on-search) now talks of investing $2.5bn per year for up to 5 years to claim back the high ground. Balmer: "In our industry, the number one mistake that people make is that they quit too early." Not the kind of guy you want to pick a fight with, eh Larry & Sergey?

In fairness, [Bing](http://www.google.com/search?btnI=I%27m%20Feeling%20Lucky&q=Bing) is growing on me. I even switched for a time when I found Bing’s image search better and less noisy than Google’s – such heresy!
