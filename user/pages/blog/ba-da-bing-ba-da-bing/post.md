Looks like Microsoft are taking the search business ever more serious. Having just launched Bing, [Balmer](http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2009/06/19/ballmer-prepared-to-spend-225-billion-per-year-on-search) now talks of investing $2.5bn per year for up to 5 years to claim back the high ground. Balmer: "In our industry, the number one mistake that people make is that they quit too early." Not the kind of guy you want to pick a fight with, eh Larry & Sergey?

I even switched for a time when I found Bing’s image search better and less noisy than Google’s – such heresy!

Say you search for Jaguar and get a mixture of cars and cats. Clicking on ‘Similar Images’ beneath the picture of say, the cat, gives you images of only Jaguar cats and ignores the car.
