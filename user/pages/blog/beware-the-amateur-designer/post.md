You know the story – you propose a re-design of a web site or app. Then at some point the client has a eureka moment and thinks he’ll ‘have a go’. How do you tread the delicate path of entreating collaboration with a client while preserving their own design integrity – or just carefully rejecting a daft idea!

[TheOatMeal.com](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell) has a good post on the deteriorating relationship between client and designer until as the author put it, he fired the client.

I particularly like the piece describing the feelings of a deflated designer contemplating a career change - “You begin to fantasize about other careers, like someone who digs ditches for a living or gives sponge baths to the elderly.” At the risk alienating a few students, that line hit a chord!
