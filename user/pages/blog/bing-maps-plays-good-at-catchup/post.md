[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/16/photosynth-creator-walks-us-through-bing-maps-gives-us-a-taste/) had a good piece today on the updates to MS’s [Bing Maps](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/www.bing.com/maps). At [TED 2010](http://blog.ted.com/2010/02/augmentedrealit.php) last week in Long Beach, Blaise Aguera y Arcas (of [SeaDragon](http://www.seadragon.com/) fame) presented his recent work on Bing Maps which to my mind right now, has Google Maps on the back foot.

Here’s what I like:

* Using SeaDragon technology, the transition down in zoom level is seamless – no jerky refresh. One layer of zoom is carefully blended into the next level.
* When set to auto, the zooming transitions from terrain to road map to satellite imagery and onwards to street level imagery. Here however MS has some work to do to achieve the level of coverage that Google has.
* [Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/default.aspx) – some crowd sourcing is rearing its head here. While browsing a map you can call up Photosynth stacks that ordinary [Joes](http://www.bing.com/maps/explore/#5003/0.6791=psm:&1.6793=ps::dtpfilter:All:poi:Micro&2.6002=q:golden+gate+bridge:lat:45.5513018117754:long:-122.671571341073:nosp:0:adj:0&o=&a=0:1:2/5872/cid=563bd1bf-5cf1-4453-90c4-0a8078f3690a&lat=37.815576&lon=-122.473546&z=15&pid=6791) have uploaded and these are seamlessly integrated into the street level imagery thereby supplementing the weaker street-view inventory of MS.
* This bit is really clever – MS raid Flickr’s photo store examining the geotags on photos and using them to create a patchwork of street-view-level imagery. One nice benefit of this is that we get to see images from indoors wherever anyone has shot a photo and uploaded it.
* I like the way the street and place names disappear when you stop moving momentarily so that you can enjoy the clean images of the [locale](http://www.bing.com/maps/explore/#5003/0.6002=bid:YN926x20939938:adj:0&1.6002=k:pike+street+market:l:seattle:lat:37.8155743933152:long:-122.473546331122:nosp:1:adj:0:notr:0:pg:1&2.6793=ps::dtpfilter:All:poi:Micro&3.6002=q:golden+gate+bridge:lat:45.5513018117754:long:-122.671571341073:nosp:0:adj:0&o=&a=0:1:2:3/5872/style=auto&lat=ry157z&lon=4t4g4z&alt=-1.31494&z=17&pid=5874).
* Aerial images – despite Google’s excellent [satellite](http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/12/google-hops-on-a-new-satellite-to-watch-us-from-space/) imagery, Bing brings that and more to the party. Aerial photos let you view the world from multiple angles, letting you ‘fly’ around objects – and at a resolution unmatched by the satellite cameras.
* And finally for the buzz-word of the moment – Augmented Reality. We’ve seen this for the [iPhone](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/2009/11/future-of-interfaces.html) lately but Blaise shows an impressive impromptu live video linkup near the end of his talk with local poi (points of interest) superimposed on the feed – what’s more, it actually worked!

It’s rare to see a standing ovation at TED (the bar is pretty high) but Blaise got one for MS.
