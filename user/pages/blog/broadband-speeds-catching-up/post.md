And now for some good news. [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/) show in a just-released report that Ireland is racing up the broadband speed charts, up a staggering 73% yoy. What happened? It’ll be interesting how [Imagine](http://www.imagine.ie/wimax-splash/index.html)’s WiMax (now installing in Sligo) helps these numbers next year.

Of course what these numbers don’t show is the cost of broadband. Now that would be real change.
