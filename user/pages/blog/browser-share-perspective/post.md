A example of good data [visualisation](http://www.axiis.org/examples/BrowserMarketShare.html) from W3School showing the changes in market share for various browsers since 2002 (Hail, Netscape). Itâ€™s interactive so you can hover to explore the detail. Note the near domination of Firefox and the growing Chrome presence.
