This is a [talk](http://blog.ted.com/2008/06/chris_jordan.php) that photographer [Chris Jordan](http://chrisjordan.com/) made at TED, a conference of 1000 brilliant minds that convene each year at Monterey, California.
Chris paints a fascinating picture of the daily un-noticed excesses that we participate in – albeit on a minute individual basis. However, with nigh on 7 billion of us perpetrating these individual mini-excesses, it mounts up – I’ll never look at a paper cup the same way again.
