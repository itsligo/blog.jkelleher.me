Deborah [Adler](http://www.deborahadler.com/) (with introduction by Bill Buxton) provided an interesting Day Two [keynote speech](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/KEY02) at MIX 2009 in Las Vegas. Though certainly not a developer, Deborah presented a good example of product redesign very much from the userâ€™s perspective.

The [ClearRx](http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/merholz/2009/06/four-customer-experience-lesso.html) system for labelling prescription drugs was developed by Adler in collaboration with [Target](http://pressroom.target.com/pr/news/health-wellness/clearrx/backgrounder.aspx), a major retail chain throughout the US. Adler chose the redesign in response to problems she witnessed her grandmother having with her meds.
