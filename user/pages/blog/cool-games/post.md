It’s the usual zombies attacking your plants scenario (haven’t we seen this already!). Still, the execution (art, animation, audio, humour) and deceptively simple game-play keep hauling you back for more. Still, €19.99 is a bit much for the casual game market.

Believe it or not, 2dBoy is a 2 man outfit working (as they put it) out of whatever free wi-fi coffee shop they wander into that day. This is hard to believe when you look at what they’ve achieved with WOG. It’s on PC/Mac/Linux and WiiWare (only €15 there). There’s a free [trial](http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo) that does a good job showcasing the game. You control a collection of blobs (yea, I know but it’s hard to be more descriptive) that you need to navigate from one end of the puzzle to another, perhaps creating a bridge or tower to reach the ‘pipe’ to safety. Like [Bill Buxton](http://www.billbuxton.com/) put it in the recent MIX09 conference [keynote](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/KEY01), it’s more about the changing of state than the states themselves that matters. It’s the way in which you engage with these cutes blobs and watch them follow your instruction that makes it immersive. It’s easy to begin to (steady now) ‘care’ for your family of blobs and to ‘not lose a man’.

This is the business. This is what €0.79 buys you in the casual game market. Again, we’re talking game play, not horsepower, flash graphics, special effects. It’s all about the immersive experience and the interaction. This brings out the killer feature (multi-touch) of the iPhone.

Simple objective: land (by dragging a glide path) each aircraft at the right airport – red planes to red strip, yellow to yellow and blue helicopters to the helipads. The trick is to not crash them into each other. Sounds simple eh? This you learn in about 5 seconds but there is great scope for _the how_ – what’s your approach, how do you plan for busy skies, where can you ‘park’ a craft, and who should I prioritise?

This is un-put-down-able [sic]. Best game I’ve played in years. You have been warned!
