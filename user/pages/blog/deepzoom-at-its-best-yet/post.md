Had I known of this service from [Zoomery](http://mix10.zoomery.com/), I’d have put away my camera last week at MIX10. DeepZoom has always been a solution in search of a problem. Zoomery have happened upon a really commanding use for the technology.

The initial screenshot on the left shows all the slideshows during the conference arranged in categories. Double-clicking zooms in to show the title slide (see right shot) with each of the individual slides underneath, viewable on further zooming. It doesn’t really need explaining – good design never does.
