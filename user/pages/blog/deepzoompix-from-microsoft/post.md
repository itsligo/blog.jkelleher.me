Above you’ll find an interesting example of Silverlight in action, coupled with Microsoft’s [DeepZoom](http://deepzoompix.com/Default.aspx) feature. If you max the screen using the icon in the top-right you’ll be able to play fully with the widget.

Watch how quickly the images appear to download – DeepZoom is clever in how it streams only the data that needs to be displayed within the window you’re viewing.
