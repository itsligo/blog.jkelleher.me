Michael Smuga, Albert Shum, Chad Roberts

Albert kicks off talking about Metro, a new design language, to frame the discussion about UI decisions on the Windows Phone 7 Series. The key principles being:

## Principle: Clean, light, Open, Fast

* Feels fast and responsive
* focus on primary tasks
* do a lot with very little
* _fierce reduction _of unnecessary elements
* delightful use of whitespace
* full bleed canvas

## Principle: Celebrate typography

* Type is beautiful
* Clear, straightforward info design
* _Uncompromising _sensitivity to weight, balance and scale

## Principle: Alive in Motion

* Feels responsive and alive
* Creates a System
* Gives _context_ to improve usability
* Transition between UI is as important as the design of the UI
* Add Dimensions and Depth

Use motion to drive curiosity, highlight changes.

## Principle: Content, not Chrome

* Delight through content instead of decoration
* Reduce visuals that are not content
* Contents is the UI
* _Direct_ interaction with the Content

makes the experience more emersive when you strip out the chrome, focus on the users’ content

## Principle: Authentically Digital

* Design for the Form Factor
* Don’t try to be _What It’s Not_
* Be Direct

Glance & Go rather than a list of apps. Second achievement is to ‘break through the frame’ using full bleed screens. Albert spoke of a curated view of you data – e.g. your photos showing as backgrounds.

### Michael Smuga

Focus on designing the experience – make them delightful and easy to use. Then they show the Anna and Miles video underlining the need to develop personas – across continents and countries – to see how they accomplish their tasks. He speaks of ‘Life-maximisers’ – more settled than seeking, balancing work, family, friends and personnel needs. Michael tells us about Anna’s daily routine, her commute, how she views her work. These are the people to whom the product is targeted.

Red Threads – brand promises to end users.

Personal – made for you caters to _your_ needs.
Relevance – info just for you, your connections, your social links.
Connected – to the cloud, social network.

Don’t tire the user by overusing motion or colour – watch pace, sprinkle motion/colour to add delight and interest. Expression tools make this easy.

Provide consistent and predictable experience – use the Metro design language (e.g. overhanging text to suggest further pivoting, i.e. side scrolling).

### Chad Roberts

Chad summarises the key points:
