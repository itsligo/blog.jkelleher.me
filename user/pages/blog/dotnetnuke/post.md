# DotNetNuke

![](http://www.appsolo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/DotNetNuke-portfolio-img-300x201.png)DotNetNuke is a content management system deployed to manage educational resources for class groups at IT Sligo. It competes in a similar space to Drupal and Joomla. The specification here called for a one-stop shop for students - class notes, assignments, past exams, results, commentary, feedback etc. Though a standard Learning Management System (LMS) is already in use at IT Sligo (Moodle) - it presents a restrictive structure for learning and customising it presents challenges for service providers. DotNetNuke (unlike many alternatives) is delivered using ASP.NET which is a compiled language and therefore enjoys significant performance benefits over interpreted solutions such as PHP. This particular install of DotNetNuke is heavily customised to deliver a cohesive set of services to students. Achieving a critical mass for these services is important to encourage students to use the system as a hub for all class-related issues. This helps to relieve pressures on lecturing staff and ensure an even and fair level of service to all students.
