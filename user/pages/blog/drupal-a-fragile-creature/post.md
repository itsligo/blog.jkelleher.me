Ever keen to push the CMS envelop, I took [Drupal ](http://www.drupal.org/)for an extended test drive recently. Having done a good few miles with DotNetNuke 4.4 and scared (with good reason) to attempt an update, I listened to the salesman and kicked off anew with Drupal.
Initial impressions from the show-room were good - comprehensive theming making it hard to know there was a CMS lurking under the hood, serious module support, and a thriving dev community.

Now the thing with Drupal is that it isn't WordPress meaning that you can just climb aboard and push out a site in a few hours. Drupal's key atomic element is a node and you can impose just about any structure you like around these nodes. Even simple things like imposing a navigation menu can be troublesome.

However some of the included modules are nothing short of brilliant. For example, I can create a custom node that my students can fill, say, to provide Project details. I can control what fields appear on that node (e.g. Project title, class, due date) and then perform queries against those nodes and display them whatever way I like.

Sadly, the test drive ended in a crash ;) And this bit is unforgiveable - setting an innocuous optimisation option in the admin menu brings Drupal down with the (known) WSOD - "White Screen of Death". Now, maybe I'm getting too demanding of my software but really, that button should have a big warning sticker all over it. So, now I'm resting before diving into the database (once I find it) and cleaning shop. Could I recommend Drupal? Nope....
