This Flash [visualisation](http://www.ebayholiday.com/black-friday) of sales made through eBay during Black Friday (traditionally busiest retail day in States – day after Thanksgiving). It’s interesting to watch the latency in transactions from East to West tracking the sun. The obvious hotspots in the tri-state area and in California glow red-hot making a nice contrast with the fly-over states. For the really curious, you can zoom in to spot individual sales – watch for the 1 million transaction barrier being broken near mid-night.
