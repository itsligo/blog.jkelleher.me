Microsoft have recently shipped the latest version of Expression Studio and Silverlight 3. In keeping with recent trends, Silverlight 3 ![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SsIf4CZQXWI/AAAAAAAAE9Q/J0wwMAV9OkY/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800)is being beefed up considerably with an emphasis on smooth HD video and improved controls.

Check out the videos at [www.seethelight.com](http://www.seethelight.com/) for the official launch.

Blend 3 is the backbone of the product and adds an interesting new SketchFlow feature which should prove popular for wire-framing and prototyping. This should help designers/developers test out designs before committing resources.
