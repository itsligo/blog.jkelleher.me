I looked in the recent past at Expression Media Encoder, a small but useful part of the Expression Suite. I hoped it would provide a good (albeit not free) alternative to CamStudio. It bombed - and after 2 hours of encoding. Since then CamStudio 2.5 has been released and is as good as ever.
However, ever looking a another way to skin a cat, I relooked at Encoder and fed it a >900mb AVI file to convert to WMV. This time, it worked flawlessly and generated a very hi-qual encoding. I suspect Windows [Media Encoder](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/2007/10/composing-posting-videos.html) does as good (or better) a job, the interface on this Encoder has some bells and whistles. It (for example) lets you add a simple leader video (and trailer), add a watermark (also in CamStudio 2.5) and any number of codec settings (nicer than Windows Media Encoder).
What I like most is the Live Encoding option (again available with Windows Media) which is well presented. And best of all, you can select a portion of your video and compress it on the fly to see what the results would be like.
I'm not throwing out Windows Media Encoder just yet - after all, it's free - but Expression Media Encoder is free under Academic Alliance and is oh so nice to use...
