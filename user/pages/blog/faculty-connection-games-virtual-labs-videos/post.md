After this workshop, participants should be able to develop simple 2D games (e.g., PacMan, or Space Invader) with interesting textures (e.g., you own photographs) and audio (e.g., your own voice) effects.

Another useful resource is [Microsoft Academic Days on Game Development 2008](http://www.facultyresourcecenter.com/curriculum/pfv.aspx?ID=7304) - Games, Robots, and Robot Games: Complementary Contexts for Introductory Computing Education. I just noticed that I was actually at this conference out of Miami last year – geez, wish I’d asked a question now!
