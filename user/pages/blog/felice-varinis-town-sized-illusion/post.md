The buildings in the town of Vercorin in the Swiss Alps contribute to an impressive piece by [Felice Varini](http://www.varini.org/), called _Cercle et suite d'Ã©clats_. The pattern was projected on the town from the vantage point, then traced and painted. Photographs from the same spot in daylight make the town look flat, almost like a postcard. What I'd like to know is how he got the town to go along with it; I could see an easily-repainted suburb in the States being convinced, but this quaint (and much older) town in Switzerland seems like a much bigger challenge. Don't miss the [panorama picture](http://www.varini.org/08agra/dos2009/004-agr-09.html) on Varini's site.
