![](http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windows/images/products/windowsvista/quick_vista.gif)Just installed Vista and Ubuntu (more on this later). Here's my first impressions:


* Faster, though every OS probably needs to be reinstalled every year or so to clear out the cobwebs. I'm guessing though that 2Gb RAM and a decent dual core processor are real necessities. Still, the prefetching of commonly used programs seems to work well - VS2005 loads in a flash.
* Hot, Vista rus the graphics much harder so prepare for a lot of heat from your laptop. Not an ideal situation longterm but probably only a problem on laptops with decent graphics cards. Still, the 3d flip windows thingy is cool.
* UAC (User Account Control) is a BIG pain. Basically, Vista hides the Administrator logon to keep you safe. Ok, maybe this will help with spyware but even trying to run a defrag requires you to switch user to the local machine admin and then back again. This gets tired real fast. Solution: turn it off but that won't work for everything so add your domain user to the Administrator group - this even requires you to log in as local user with admin privileges.
* Pressing the window key and typing the first few letters of a program or file name brings up a list of matching files etc. - like Launchy. There are quite a few things that are now built-in which makes for a simpler system.

* Office 2007: jury's out on this one just yet. Don't like the changed file format (and it isn't even OpenDoc) and this will be a problem for those sharing office files with others that don't use Office 2007.
There's a lot in it and any change is a pain but it's a mild thumbs up for now.
