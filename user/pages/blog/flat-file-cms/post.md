Having playing with several CMSs down the ages (Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress and DotNetNuke), I find that it's time to simplify things. Wordpress is great and probably the best of those I've used but lately I find that I'm less in control than ever. For something that holds a lot of important information, I felt that it could be lost too easily and require a bunch of arcane instruction to resurrect it. For me this is the time of year for spring-cleaning so I started to look about for alternatives.

Actually my journey began with Github that I'm finding very interesting. Seems you can ['host' a site](http://pages.github.com) as a repository if you follow a few simple rules. Okay, it can't be very sophisticated but I think the focus should be more on the content than the underlying tech. Git uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by John Gruber which I instantly loved. Think of it as a simple text formatting syntax - like html only much simpler. It is supported by many editors and Git will automatically convert your markdown to html when your site is rendered. The best bit of course is how seamless the site update experience is, thanks to Git. Just commit and push your updates to Git and it's live. (Well, in my case I found the 'lag' before my updates showed to be in the order of 5 minutes but others don't report that problem as common) That immediacy of updates is attractive especially compared to long-winded posting in WordPress.

If you want to know more on this, it's worth checking out Jekyll which [Git uses](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) (automatically) with your markdown text. This adds templating to the equation giving a greater expressiveness to your web pages. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is what is called a static site editor, and is written in Ruby. Static site editors take your markdown and (like a compiler with source code) renders html during a build process. You then upload these html pages (which can include css) to your server. This is actually a neat solution yielding very efficient html. Github runs Jekyll automatically against your markdown pages so the process is simple. However, for greater flexibility you can do this process yourself - here's [some guidelines](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html).

Better yet, use [Octopress](http://blog.assimov.net/blog/2012/03/24/tumblr-to-octopress-powered-by-jekyll-and-markdown/): a framework for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), it adds some sugar to Jekyll, such as HTML templates, CSS, JavaScripts and configuration. I was smitten with Jekyll pretty early on and Octopress helped iron out any wrinkles in the former but now I felt that I was juggling too much by way of command prompt magic and took fright. This should be easier so kept looking.

###Flat-file CMS
Flat-file CMSs sit a little higher up the food chain, kinda half-way between static site generators and full CMSs. And this I like. The big caveat here is they don't use a database which is fine with me. The market is thick with choice here but notable mentions are: [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) (more later), [Stacey](http://www.staceyapp.com), and [Statamic](http://statamic.com) - here's a good [comparison](http://wpdaily.co/3-non-db-cms/). Stacey is open-source while the other two are c. $30. I looked at each up close and like Statamic and Kirby but felt that [Bastian Allgeier](http://bastianallgeier.com) really shines in support and felt he truly cared for this baby of his. Plus for education, he'll knock 50% off the price. I was in. All three use a small PHP code footprint to drive the site. But you can package up your entire site in a simple folder (for backup or forking) which is a delight. The basic principle of organising content is inspired. Just create a folder and pop in a humble text file (in markdown if you like, and you will). That folder becomes the first level page - say, "jkwp.itsligo.ie/about" will render from the presence of an 'about' folder with a text file therein. The text file can be called anything but if you match it with a simple template (run up with PHP) of the same name then you have great control over the appearance of that page. Or more typically, a collection of similarly templated pages. Needless to say, it screams along thanks to the absence of a database call. I had my 'site' up an running in minutes along with [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) to host the local site on my Mac. (Not so with WAMP, but more on that later).

But that's not all... the best bit is that Dropbox has a role to play here. If you keep your site content (which is really mostly a collection of folders and text files) in Dropbox, then you can install a Dropbox client on the server. So now when you make a change on your local machine to the site content in Dropbox, your page is instantly mirrored on the server. In fact, you can do this from any device that supports Dropbox. And since the 'pages' are just Markdown the editing is trivial. Another nice feature of Kirby is the use of YAML (YAML ain't a markup language - don't you dig recursion!). Each text file (typically of Markdown) can have a YAML front matter section where you can specify on-the-fly key/value pairs. For example, you could have a 'category' field or a 'author' field. These values can later be used in templates to pull together custom collections of pages or to generate menus or side-bar content. The PHP in question is trivial and Bastian has provided a useful Kirby toolkit which is elegant in operation.

So far, the Kirby experience is very promising. Check out [jkwp.itsligo.ie](http://jkwp.itsligo.ie) as I build out the content. Now the decision is which CSS framework to use or if I borrow a basic grid framework and skin it myself. I learned a lot about IIS and WAMP in the process of migrating to Kirby. Check out here for details of that. Also, read more on my choice of editor to pump the site full of content. If you're moving from Wordpress Bastian hosts a Wordpress Exporter which is something I might checkout.
