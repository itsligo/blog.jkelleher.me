[Brett Cawley and the first set of Judges at Games Fleadh 2010](http://vimeo.com/10059580) from [Paul Powell](http://vimeo.com/user1473827) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/).




Brett Cawley entered the long-standing Games Fleadh competition run by Tipperary Institute. Check out the video of his presentation to the judges. Brett is a 2nd year student on the B.Sc. Computing (Software Development) programme.




> _Update: _Brett came 2nd in his category just beaten by NUIG (team of 2). He also picked up a special commendation for original artwork. Congratulations to Brett and Paul Powell, his mentor.


This begs the question â€“ if our Software Development guys are this good, what happens when we unleash our XNA Games Programming squad!
