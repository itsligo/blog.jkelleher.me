One of the challenges of working in the Mac environment while developing in Microsoft technologies is getting the VM machine working as you want. Being a fan of keyboard shortcuts, it's a major PITA if the key mappings aren't set as you'd expect, especially as I move routinely between Mac and Windows PC. So, with my Parallels 7 and Windows 8 setup, do the following to get it just right:

1. In Parallels, choose Preferences...Keyboard and ensure Virtual Machine Shortcuts are off.
2. At the bottom of that box, I leave 'Enable Mac OSX system shortcuts' enabled to give me the Fn controls across the top of my keyboard. This means I have to press Fn with, say, F6 to compile in VS2012 but that's how I prefer it.
3. That's all she wrote.
