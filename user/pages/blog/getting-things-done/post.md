Just finished reading [David Allen](http://www.davidco.com/)’s book ‘[Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280)’. ![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SlJQAP0sEQI/AAAAAAAAElk/eCo4P_dXtB0/image_thumb%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800)For those who haven’t come across this before, Allen is a very successful author, consultant and coach in productivity.

I found the opening chapters very useful with the latter sections not really adding anything of note.

He made good points around clearing everyday ‘stuff’ from your mind by physically committing it to a to-do list. This relieves the stress of the conflict associated with remembering all the things we have to do or planned to do and just now can’t.

I do subscribe to the gist of his thesis and use GMail as a poor man’s aid. By creating labels in GMail (now well improved) for emails that need to be actioned, I can always call up with a simple keyboard shortcut - G for go, L for label and then the first few letters of the label. Google Calendar is useful to schedule things that need doing in the future and there is plenty room for notes about that event. GMail also does a good job of helping you record your actions which, according to Allen, are ‘defer, delegate and dump’.
