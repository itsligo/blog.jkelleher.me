I played about with it when it first came out and being somewhat flakey, I happily went back to Firefox. The lack of extensions (LastPass, Delicious, mouse gestures) for Chrome as well as the fact that a good friend of mine works for Mozilla in San Francisco (hi John!) kept me away.

Having taken the latest dev release (think late beta) I can tell you it’s fast – very fast. Maybe I’ve loaded Firefox down with stuff but Chrome is scary fast. Pages just pop up and I like the way the address bar is the search bar – makes sense really given how lazy we get with having the exact address. Me likes so far….
