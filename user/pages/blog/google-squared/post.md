[Google Squared](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/google.com/squared) is a new arrival in Google [labs](http://www.googlelabs.com/). For those unfamiliar, this is where Google release future potential new tools for their range of apps. Graduation from the labs is never assured but there have been some killer features.

It’s best explained with a quick example. Opposite, I searched for ‘towns cork ireland’ and (whoa) that’s just what I got – a neat summary table of some of the best towns in the country. Simple enough.

So I set it a harder job and searched for ‘iot ![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/Ss-MtQpWJYI/AAAAAAAAFCc/bZ0nUVOjEHk/image_thumb%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800)ireland’. Sure enough, it hadn’t a clue but here comes the clever bit. It asks me to give it some clearer examples of iots, which I do.

And here is the result – pretty nigh on perfect. Impressed – dead right I am.
