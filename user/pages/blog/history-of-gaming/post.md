**[Heather James](#12 "2009-10-18 18:34:51"):** I loved his presentation. But the bummer is he couldn't include all the videos he had. Lots of videos showing how the games played.

I just installed some Nitendo 64 emulators on my machine. What a blast.

Someone was talking about having a retro gaming thingy where people bring their own actual consoles and play. Could be fun for students too!
