About this time each year I tackle the mounting problem of converting camcorder footage to DVD. Right now I use [Sony Vegas Platinum](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope) which though not as nice as [Adobe Photoshop Elements](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopelwin/) does at least do me the favour of working on 64-bit Win (Adobe, what gives here?).

I would have thought that at this stage making a home DVD would be a breeze thanks to better hardware (I run with a decent [XPS laptop](http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-xps-m1330/4505-3121_7-32465545.html)) and software improvements but not yet it seems.

Vegas does a reasonably consistent video-editing role but the presumption that we live in NTSC-land rather than PAL is a pain, especially since the video capture defaults to NTSC. The capture thankfully doesn’t plague you with lots of choice – it pulls across the camcorder footage neat enough. It’s when you need to burn a bog-standard DVD that things come unstuck. First there’s an addendum application called DVD Architect that handles DVDs (chapters, menus etc.) that is just plain too hard to handle. Having it default to a NTSC (not PAL and not wide-screen) DVD is again unhelpful but it insists on having a menu system – for home movies, I think we can pass.

![DVD Flick](dvdflick.png) In the end, the easiest thing was to create a MPEG-2 file directly from Vegas and resort to [DVD Flick](http://www.dvdflick.net/). This free little program simply takes your MPG files and makes a standards-compliant DVD right down to the ISO (it even burns with [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/)). Actually, ImgBurn is very good too and can handle the creation of DVD but you gotta know about the VIDEO_TS folders and life’s just too short for that lark.

One tip for using DVD Flick that you should know: if you have a properly compressed MPEG2 file to burn then you won’t need DVD Flick to handle the transcoding (it’s already done!) so you need to tell it to pass on MPG2 encoding or you’ll worsen the final output quality. To top it all, avoid a second encoding significantly expedites the whole process.

![Picasa](picasa.png)Finally, if you’re wondering what to do with the left over space at the end of your 4.5Gb DVD+-R, you could use [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) to make a photo slideshow. It isn’t perfect but you can’t argue with the price (free). Select your favourite photos (I use the hold section at the bottom of the screen) and choose to create a movie. You can play with the transition time/effects and even add a sound track (only one though). Transitions are decent but to add a number of sound tracks, I had to take the resultant WMV file into Vegas and lay down some music tracks. In any case, the WMV would need re-encoding to work for DVDs. Still, the codec doesn’t mess things up much as given the original images are hi-res.

If ever you want to borrow one of our Macs for this purpose 'just to see'... I'll happily do so. I'd be curious as to how you evaluate the experience.

Yep.

But thanks for this, I get requests from students with Wintels who want a route for DVD authoring and I can use this. Very helpful.

1. Does your Video Recorder have an editing option built in? You could edit (add effects) before transfer and
2. Use a DVD R/W (Very Cheap)machine. We do this. We have a very old Handy Cam device but you can feed the Video and Audio output directly into the Cam inputs on the DVD R/W. My Philips DVD R/W is
