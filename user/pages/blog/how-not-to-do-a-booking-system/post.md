title: How not to do a booking system…

Trying to book a set of tickets on [www.hawkswell.com](http://www.hawkswell.com/) today, I eventually gave up – check out the video to see why. And they laughingly charge me €5 extra (for the set) for the privilege! And even this is a discount on the usual charge of €1.50. To think you’d pay money for this kind of interactive experience!

Things to watch for:

* how do I tell what days have any tickets still available?
* why is there only ‘Full’ no. tickets to choose from? What is ‘Full’?
* What does ‘Choose a Different Price Level’ do? And why does it only work when I’ve selected a number of tickets?
* Where are these seats in the theatre? Where’s the seat plan link?

On the Page for credit card payments the section for entering the Credit card details has no fields. But when you submit the page it pops back up saying that you have not put in the fields and they appear in Red!! Beat that boy!
