So far the site is rock solid stable. I've integrated several new modules (what's new, newsfeeds, shadow modules etc.). Syndication is still an issue. I really need a proper What's New module and to syndicate it rather than individual modules. That way, updates to any part of the site make it to the RSS feed.
Bought XMod ([www.dnndev.com](http://www.dnndev.com/)) so have the tools to churn out my own database-related modules. Hopefully I'll have a results database design done soon to try and retrieve data via XMod.
Set compression on the IIS and a whitespace filter so performance should be quite high now. Trials on dial-up are promissing.
Had some problem with the Inventua shadow module messing up the SideMenu but those guys at Inventua work fast - fixed module delivered this am.
