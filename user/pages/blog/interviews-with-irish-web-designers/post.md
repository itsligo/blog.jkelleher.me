The designers talk candidly about what seems to be a buoyant industry here-abouts. Decent showcase of sites follows.

One thing that raises it head is the perennial designer/developer debate and how third level can best serve the industry. Seems to me the industry churns incessantly in terms of tools, styles, fashions, needs – does this render traditional education channels impotent?
