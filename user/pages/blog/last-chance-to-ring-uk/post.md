If there's a company you want to ring in the UK, you'd better make that call. Recently, companies in the UK are jumping onto the 0870/1 bandwagon and changing their customer service lines from the old geographic numbers (e.g. 028 in Northern Ireland) to 0870 or 0871. Why do I care I hear you ask?
Well, little known fact is that apparently you can't ring an 0870/1 number from good old Eire. Yup, I've checked - at least with BT who tell me that all other providers are the same since it's an imposition by those in charge of the whole network (is that Eircom?). I've asked ComReg about this and await clarification. The reason? Well the memorised phrase from all at BT is 'for security reasons'. Basically, they think the poor customer might get hijacked into calling an expensive number. Don't buy this, myself. First, 155X numbers are way more expensive and they're not banned. Maybe BT forgot about those. Second, while 0870/1 numbers are often not cheap, they're rarely more than 20p (30c) per minute. And finally, I can still ring the 0870/1 number from my (O2) mobile - best check your overdraft facility first though.
So where are all these 0870/1 numbers coming from. Well, according to [www.saynoto0870.com](http://www.saynoto0870.com/), companies love switching. since unlike old geographic numbers, the telco shares the revenue from the call with the company, so everyone's happy - well, except the folk like us who can't even get the privilege of paying for the call!
