Okay, you know the problem. You visit yet another ‘must-register’ site, enter your email or username and pull out your stock password – one of the few words you can be sure you’ll remember. I did that on an Irish computer parts web site and surprise my password in plain text turns up on a hacked list.
Didn’t miss a beat – I’d switched everything password related to [LastPass](http://www.lastpass.com/). These canny guys provide a plug-in for IE and Firefox that manages your passwords. Yea, but Firefox does that already I hear you say. Yup, got me there but did you know it stores your precious passwords in plain text – unless you (remember to) apply a master password (bet you’re checking now). Even that master password is easily hacked. So now that I have your attention, here’s what LastPass does:

* gives you a neat secure password generator (you know, lots of punctuation and numbers)
* prompts to record your new username/password combo after you register
* automatically fills in your logon details when you re-visit a previously registered site

Great but is it more secure….

* _all _your passwords are stored both locally and on Lastpass’s two redundant secure servers – and – only in encrypted form
* it uses 256-bit AES encryption – that there’s good stuff
* you have a single (mother of all passwords) to secure access to all your encrypted ones – just tattoo it to your loved one

Wait… there’s more:

* they have a mobile (iPhone) version
* you can (if you’re the nervous type) download a small standalone app to read/edit your passwords
* they use C++/Javascript to make the plug-in work real fast at the browser
* they even back themselves up on Amazon’s S3 service – these guys are paranoid!

And the best bit – free.
