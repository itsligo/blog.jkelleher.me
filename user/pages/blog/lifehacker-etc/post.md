![](http://www.lifehacker.com/)If you're like me and think that there must be at least 99 ways to skin a cat and that your current way is surely non-optimal. Ignore that impact of entertaining all the other ways of doing things - the new way could be 'the one'.
Lifehacker, the [blog](http://www.lifehacker.com/), could be the source for you. It's a freq. updated blog so tack it to your Firefox bookmark toolbar and welcome shorter (productivity) days...
