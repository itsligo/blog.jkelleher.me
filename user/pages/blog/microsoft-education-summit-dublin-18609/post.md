Just back from another Microsoft hosted event, this one targeting educational institutes showcasing emergent tech, and reasonably well attended. We heard of: ![robot](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/Sj4bKa63rMI/AAAAAAAAEbQ/NH74ZdsutEY/robot%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800)

* quality of our graduates
* the future - Cloud computing
* Windows 7 & virtualisation
* Robotics Studio
* VS 2010

MS Ireland EDC manager, Glen Poor, gave a frank talk on the state of Irish graduates and the picture wasn’t rosy. He (and Google too) have turned to the continent (and beyond in India) to source quality. In tr uth, this didn’t come as a major surprise. When the focus is on preserving such programmes at 3r![microsoft azure](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/Sj4bKlDJs0I/AAAAAAAAEbU/kUYJd-TpWNU/microsoft%20azure%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800)d level, you know some intakes are going to be hard work. It’s a bit like recruitment into the military in the States. Glen gave some interesting insights into MS’s diligence in its recruiting. Prospective interviewees are forewarned of the need to be able to do a particular task. MS take note of activity on boards seeking help in the task given (duly noted). At interview, basic whiteboard programming proves a major stumbling block – a node insertion in a linked list often spells the end for a hopeful candidate.

Some took Glen to task on this c![microsoft-expression-logo-article](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/Sj4bLS_HKvI/AAAAAAAAEbY/2ZdwSbvg4Fc/microsoft-expression-logo-article%5B4%5D.png?imgmax=800)iting the scope and depth of the tools on offer from MS and how difficult it can be to nurture students’ interest and ability in the field. I would add that picking something like a linked list insertion is disingenuous – why should I bother learning this when I have a rich library of data structures to choose from (and consume)? The whole point of these libraries was to enable programmers to build bigger, better apps quicker rather than start with a blank screen every time. Of course, I’m not going to fixate with a linked list when I have to use complex data binding to get the job done. I’ll take whatever supports are around. I no longer know how to start a fire, or generate power, or program my VCR either!

There were some talks on [F#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/), [Robotic Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/robotics/bb727194.aspx), and [Expression](http://expression.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx)/Sliverlight. I like the last two a lot and when I fully _get_ F#, I’m sure I’ll be awed! I must say I do find it a challenge when the speakers don’t use English as their first language. None of these talks _inspired_ me even though these folk obviously knew their stuff. With topics like robots and the coolest UX experience since Apple did their thing, you’d think it’d be a slam dunk. There is so much going on in the Expression/Silverlight space – so why are we still seeing the Laguna Coupe and Hard Rock demos. These are academics and want to see real apps, not the marketing gimmicks. They can handle (and want to know) the technical bits. Tell us why data binding is so much better, or why XAML is worth the effort or how Silverlight 3.0 stacks up against Flash & Flex.

**Worthy mentions:** Dave Northey spoke well on the merits of Windows 7 & virtualisation. Never been wholly sold on virtualisation but this guy spoke from an obvious position of knowledge, passion and confidence – and it showed.
Liam Cronin, Academic Engagement manager, MS, for organising the event. Not sure if these events happened pre-Liam but much appreciated. They do a lot to help bring academics together as well as push the MS agenda (not always a bad thing!). Pulling these days together is I’m sure a night-mare – keeping them on time is a tour de force! The fact that we’re now blogging about these events and bringing that back to our students, is, I’m sure, testimony to their success. _Now, just how many more do I need to go to, before I win that darn XBox360?!_
