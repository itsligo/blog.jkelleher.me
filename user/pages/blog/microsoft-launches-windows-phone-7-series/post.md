Seems it’s lucky number 7 for MS. [Windows 7](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsoft-Reports-Strong-Earnings-Off-Windows-7-Sales-704775/) has notched up 60 million licence sales to end Jan 2010, pushing revenues for that division from $4.06bn to $6.9bn in a single year.

Now, they hope ‘7’ will sprinkle some of that magic to their [beleaguered phone division](http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/editorial-ten-reasons-why-windows-mobile-6-5-misses-the-mark/). Most believed that MS would postpone the next mobile OS until later in the year but on Monday last, Steve Balmer took the stage in Barcelona to launch Windows Phone. And it’s very, well, _different_. It seems MS’s investment in UX designers is starting to pay off (see my earlier post on Bing [Maps](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/2010/02/bing-maps-plays-good-at-catchup.html)). There’s plenty of iPhone-like aspects but the iPhone experience while good is pretty one-dimensional. The interface doesn’t scale well. Nor do the apps integrate well with one another. For example, the icons on the iPhone are ‘dumb’ – on the Windows Phone they can be third party apps which update themselves with say, new Facebook profile photos.

This brings me to my pet issue with Apple – their need to absolutely, totally control the _whole_ experience. iPhone apps are completely sandboxed. Windows has always provided a more _open_ experience. Thanks to this open architecture, Windows-based devices let developers reach out to the myriad of web-hosted data. I want a device that shares my work and makes some decisions on my behalf. I don’t want apps that work well but only work in their own space and unaware of everything else. When I read about Windows Phone 7 Series, the words that come to mind are _integrated_ and _open_. Have MS learned from Apple in this new market? The second to market has a lot of lessons to learn from. Palm Pilot anyone?
