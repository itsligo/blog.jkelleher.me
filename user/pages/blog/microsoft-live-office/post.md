![Office Live logo](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/Sj59_vv-coI/AAAAAAAAEbc/cBnG_JnTyUE/Office%20Live%20logo%5B11%5D.gif?imgmax=800) I know they’re not there yet (heck, I hope that’s the case) but having just received my first invite to view something shared on this ‘[Office in the Cloud](http://www.officelive.com/)’, I can’t say I’m impressed.

Despite being logged into Windows Live already, the share had been issued to me under a different account. It forces me to log out and log in (although it does this automatically) – BUT these two accounts are linked in Windows Live so I’ve already authenticated one account to another.

Then, I want to view the shared doc so I click on it and away it goes telling me to download the Live Add-In. Sounds painless enough so I comply. Then I’m told I have to do a _reboot – _now I’m running a fully patched install of Windows 7 so why in this day and age am I doing reboots. This should never be the case, not anymore.

So maybe this stuff is just _hard_ and no bad Microsoft. I’ve played with [Google Docs](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/docs.google.com) and while not perfect – it’s harder for those non-Gmail folk to use – it’s pretty straight-forward. The best I’ve found is [DropBox ](http://www.getdropbox.com/)– simply bliss if you’ve got DropBox installed but still clearer even if that’s not the case.

If we’re all going to be living in the ‘Cloud’ to-morrow, this stuff has got to get easier. Until then, I’m still buying (well, in the academic sense, aka free) Office!

Although I haven't seen a Save to office Live yet?? Its a little bit like the way the Live writter works, hence the re-boot I'd say. Also as it is in Beta they would not role it out with Window 7? Later Paul.
