# Mike Taulty talks RIA Services

Now that VS2010 and Silverlight 4 have finally gone RTM, so too has RIA services come of age. Though there are [other means](http://wildermuth.com/2009/09/29/Choosing_a_Data_Access_Layer_for_Silverlight_3) of bridging the client/server data divide, namely ADO.NET data services, RIA Services brings plenty of conveniences (such as validation on both sides and hiding the asynchronous data querying). Mike Taulty is with the Developer and Platform Group at Microsoft in the UK. He has posted superbly in the past on LINQ-to-SQL and MVVM and this video provides an excellent introduction to RIA Services.
