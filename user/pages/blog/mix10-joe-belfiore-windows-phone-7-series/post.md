Listening to Joe Belifore follow-on from the keynote, it’s interesting to hear just how seriously they take the use of scenarios and personas. WinPhone 7 series use the live tiles as the heart of the experience, seeing real info without entering an app – glance-able information. For example, seeing the music I’ve been listening to lately.

He talks of the focus on typography over graphics, full bleed to screen edges, the animation above the static display. The start menu is completely customisable – you can promote people to a live tile on the home page and get updates on that person’s status.

Calendar emulates the deepzoom interface, again with the focus on transitions. Hardware is still prototype-standard but surprisingly robust through the on-stage demos. A good example of interface (vis a viz iPhone UX) is when you mis-spell. The design supports your effort to type exceptionally quickly at the cost of accuracy – it makes it easy to examine your message and pick words to replace mis-spelled words – it makes the suggestions.

Good example shown of Bing  decision-engine – Joe types ‘Alaska 604’ and Bing gives you the time of departure/arrival of that flight, recognising that this is a flight and not some cryptic code. Similar with ‘Avatar’ keyword and it yields showtimes for the film _locally_ rather than just basic information. They’re doing this for celebs, stocks, weather etc.   All this is live and gutsy demo’ing!

_Sneak-peek:_ Joe opens an email to click on an xls file and opens into mobile Office Excel. Dunno know how usable this level of zoom is. Now looking at Office hub but we’re not seeing anymore right now. One nice touch is the ability to go back from the home page, back through Office Excel, the Office hub and back to the original email – crossing the application boundary.
