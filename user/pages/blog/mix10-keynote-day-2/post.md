Scott Guthrie kicks off today’s talks with a look at the new IE9 Platform Preview. The major point is full HTML 5 support which for now doesn’t amount to much other than plug-in free video. Scott Hanselman takes over to run through the other features which consist of the usual ‘conform to standards’ pledge. IE9 will also make the most of GPU acceleration and several demos showed IE9 hammering Chrome and Firefox with animated pages – not a show stopper but there is a lot of rendering time when we view a page and so this does speed things up. Same story with Javascript interpreting and IE9 comes with a new Javascript interpreter which (currently) puts it on a par with Chrome/Firefox but then the latter is about to rollout their new interpreter.

However, the takeaway wasn’t all that exciting. I still find the mashing of Javascript, CSS, JQuery, JSON and god-knows what else to be a very messy way to code. When you contrast the single dev tools (okay, maybe 2 if you use Blend) with the mixed bag I mentioned, I find it hard to find the merit of sticking with the non-plug-in approach.

There’s a lot of folk talking about making data – anyone’s data – available to the internet, primarily with the view to monitise it. MS provide ‘Dallas’ as an effective marketplace where you can set your own terms of use, cost etc. and make it available to the masses. [Open Data Protocol](http://www.odata.org/) makes this a relatively easy move. As I understand it, it allows you to take a web service that you create (say, using WCF) and when you move it to Windows Azure or SQL Azure (or MS Sharepoint), you can tick a box (no, really) and this creates a JSON or ATOM feed for viewing or updating your data. The main thrust here seems to be go get our data – and we can charge you for it.
