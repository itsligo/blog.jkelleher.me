These are primarily in mp3 or wav format and of course, work for platforms other than Flash (e.g. Silverlight, XNA etc.). These assets are generally of high quality well suited to games or rich interactive apps.

For games, it’s often useful to have some simple art work (even as

placeholders for eventual art). The guys at [Lost Garden](http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) have a neat selection (click each image). ![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SvG0I7YFLoI/AAAAAAAAFFc/Bj3E9jnZLzU/image10%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800)
