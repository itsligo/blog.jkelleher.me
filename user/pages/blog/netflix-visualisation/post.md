Thanks to [Tommy Weir](http://www.tinyplanet.eu/) for this one. The [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/01/10/nyregion/20100110-netflix-map.html) shows a great visualisation of the purchasing patterns for DVDs rented through [NetFlicks](http://www.netflix.com/).

It’s like a case study of [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and just goes to show that with the right presentation we can sift through great big chunks of raw data to ‘see’ the message. Try it and you’ll find that you can understand why the colour is more saturated in one place than another – it even informs your own choices. Then remember where all these raw numbers came from and how they’ve been used to paint a picture.

While I’m at it, you should read Tommy’s post about the future for Apple’s [iSlate](http://gizmodo.com/5447218/rumor-apples-tablet-is-an-iphone-on-steroids) (or whatever). We geeks might balk at the wasted opportunity to cram another ‘neat’ feature into a device. Apple are incredibly discriminating but know that their audience wants simplicity and that’s what they get. Right now folk want an un-tethered device to guide them in the digital arena, to read a blog, send a mail, buy a track, view a photo, play a movie. Us developers are all about maximum effect, over engineering, extending the feature set – the user doesn’t care, he just has a job to do.
