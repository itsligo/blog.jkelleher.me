Imagine the apocalypse. Now imagine characters and elements from 80ies games carrying it out. This is exactly what this crazy video portrays, and being a classic games geek myself, if this sort of thing were to happen in real life, I’m not sure whether I’d run or marvel at the sight.

It’s all there – Pacman, Tetris, Arkanoid. Once friendly, familiar characters wreak havoc on the buildings, streets and cars of New York. The [video was created by Patrick Jean](http://gizmodo.com/5512177/evil-8+bit-forces-destroy-new-york) from the Paris-based special effect studio [One More Production](http://www.onemoreproduction.com/), and the production level is nothing short of amazing. See for yourself.
