Those who listen to me talk about HCI (Human Computer Interaction) – yea, I know some students don’t have a choice – will know I’m a fan of paper prototyping.

Originally proposed by [Marc Rettig](http://www.fitassociates.com/aboutUs.html) ([interview](http://www.designingforinteraction.com/rettig.html)), it hits a sweet spot for prototyping – ensuring enough detail to be useful (to test users) and not too much that they (and us designers) get bogged down in trivial aesthetic issues (or the tools that make the prototype).

> _Incidentally Marc kindly offered to provide a copy of his seminal work on Paper Prototyping, “Prototyping for Tiny Fingers”, to the HCI class, in perpetuity – thanks Marc._

For those not in the know, paper prototyping (PP from here out ‘cause my fingers hurt) is a rapid means of mocking up an interface to a reasonable level of fidelity with the design such that real users can work though a task interaction. Given that the prototype is put together with simple hand-drawn interface widgets and not embellished with (for now) irrelevant adornment, the user instantly recognises that this is a prototype and doesn’t fixate on the decoration and instead pays attention to the task in hand. This addresses the more critical aspect of our design – does it support the task.

Other obvious advantages are that it’s cheap, accessible to all with minimal training, provides near-immediate results, highly iterative (since we haven’t invested much in the creation of the prototype) and brings user feedback into the design at an early stage. It also encourages us developer/designers from jumping into dev tools too early and have a particular design approach suggested to us via such tools.

For example, it was always easy to spot a Visual Basic (VB) app since the programming model meant it was convenient (for lazy programmers) to spawn another window rather than invest in proper app navigation.

As an adjunct to this, have a look at this video from [Chris Neale](http://e102.co.uk/) (of London) which takes the concept a little further by employing stop-frame animation to help communicate the interaction with PP. Sadly, his software for doing so is Mac-based but it would be relatively easy to find something similar in Windows – any takers?
