Assessment of student work is pretty time consuming process. One element that I think can be optimised is in how work is submitted and made available for correcting. I've [blogged](/blog/uploading-student-submissions/) before on [Jotform](http://jotformpro.com) which I use regularly as a reasonably convenient system. Students are presented with a form (embeddable) which permits uploads to my account. From there, Jotform can propagate to other online storage (e.g. Google drive, Dropbox) as a secondary backup. Receipts are issued to confirm the submission.

While the cloud service is good, I was interested in incorporating Git into the process given its pivotal role in software development. It would also help to leverage Github to host the submissions and reduce the cost of the Jotform solution. Unfortunately, while Github do acknowledge the role educational institutes have in furthering Git knowledge (and generously offer limited student accounts for free), there isn't a system to allow lecturers/TA to manage student submissions. The service is more tuned to development teams with mutual permissions.

So, I documented a procedure whereby students submissions could be managed. The paper was accepted for presentation at the Computer Applications and Information Systems (WCCAIS), 2014 World Congress in Tunisia in Jan '14 and later published on IEEE [XPlore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6916568&searchWithin%3Dp_Authors%3A.QT.Kelleher%2C+J..QT.).
