Something has always bugged me about Powerpoint. It's like MS have seen off the competition and sent their dev team home - about 5 years ago. A new version of Office comes about and a lick of paint is applied but that's about it. For example, does Powerpoint even know about the web?
sPresent is currently in v. 3 (beta) and is a slick online Flash program that lets you create Powerpoint-like slideshows. Ok, it won't have the same fine control of animations that PP has (and no-one knows how to invoke) but it lets you share online shows easily and has a rich feature set. Of course, it's free (even for business use currently). It's fast and you quickly forget you're using Flash.
You can animate most objects, scale, rotate, add custom animations, add a voice-over synchronised to slides, apply tranparency effects etc. etc.

I particularly liked the charting. Excel charting hasn't moved for years and looks dated. My only gripe right now is the lack of import options for either PP or Excel. The range of templates is good though and a welcome relief from the usual suspects you've come to know in PP. Most of the objects are vector (well, it is Flash) and this speeds things along nicely.

Don't think it's ready for a head to head with PP just yet. It's really more about the hassles of moving material across. If I were looking for a means of selling an idea and don't want to attach a PP to an email - just send a link to your sPresent slideshow or better yet, embed it like you can see below.

The real lesson here is that time is being called on monlithic applications - folks, we're going online!
