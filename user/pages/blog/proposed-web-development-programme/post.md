[BSc. in Web Development 2010-](http://prezi.com/tazrg07mxuwo/)

We’ve been fortunate in recent years in the Dept. Information Systems at increasing our numbers at well-above average for the sector. We now have streams for Software, Systems & Networking, Games Programming and Database. Two significant areas not yet serviced or needing an overhaul are web development and mobile computing – both huge growth areas and also with shifting or emerging requirements/solution platforms.

We as staff have wrestled with the makeup of the revamped Web Development programme (currently, a discontinued Level 8, four year, ab initio programme). What’s above in the slideshow is my take on what we should be doing for this new programme. This is an important development area and one where we’ve been burned before. I’d welcome any comments (okay, we’re reasonably thick-skinned so knock yourself out). But when judging I’d ask that you’d consider the following parameters which I’ve take into account in my outline:

1. **Economics**: We’re launching in a restrictive economic environment so there is pressure to fashion a new programme from appropriate parts of existing programmes. And so there are programming, asset creation, and project modules which are shared with other streams. Efforts to grow the student intake are hampered by the dependence on lab spaces but a happy by-product is that we can be more selective. However, I believe we need to also grow numbers especially when we can preserve points-levels in the buoyant education environment at present (and likely for a few years).
2. **Common First Year**: We operate a common first year across all our computing streams. We have found this quite useful as if affords students that extra year of maturity coupled with greater exposure to a variety of topics before they have to make a ‘career’ choice. However, as the number of streams that inherit this common first year increases, it becomes more difficult to ensure that year is appropriate across all its content. We found this particularly difficult when designing the Games Programming stream but I think less so with the proposed Web Development.
3. **Technologies**: Microsoft technologies represent an area of significant investment by the college and staff and permeate much of the existing programme streams. To me, it makes sense to capitalise on the success which this has brought and focus our efforts to maximise that investment. It also represent a key USP (unique selling point) both to prospective students (where the Microsoft brand identity is helpful) and to approving panels (to whom we need to justify our offering).
This focus comes at the expense of breadth of coverage. For example, is there time/need/expertise to accommodate Adobe Flash as well as Silverlight? Is there merit in doing both? Is there sufficient staffing to maintain these portfolios into the future? To me, it’s placing a bet – but not a high risk one. On the one hand, you can argue that employer A wants Silverlight and we teach Flash. However, how much does any new graduate know of any of these technologies. A savvy employer will look at the portfolio and see the skill-set inherent in it – the technology will shift constantly – what matters is the ability to track and adapt to these changes. The tools can’t be seen to drive the programme content. However, taking that argument further – we need tools to _enable_ and _motivate_ students to build both interest and their portfolio so those said-same employers can judge their talent. For that, I believe, we need to consolidate expertise to maximise this leverage. Now, there’ll be purist who’ll say, just give me [notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm) (hi Sabrina!) and a [moleskin](http://www.moleskine.com/), and I’ll carve you a site – me, I think we can make for a friendly first impression.
4. **Emphasis:** I’ve worked towards a balance between design and implementation in the programme. Keeping in mind that this is a B.Sc. and the programme is ‘Web _Development’ _and not ‘_Design’_, there is nonetheless significant design input – e.g. nearly half the modules in Year 2 are exclusively design, Year 3 has significant project/hands-on work. I think a mixture is necessary – many of our graduates may find work on a freelancing basis or in small houses where a multi-disciplinary skill-set is valued.

So, pile on it and have your say. Tell me why I’m wrong and test my arguments. There’s quite a bit at stake so we want to get this right.

## Comments

**[Nick](#29 "2010-03-21 23:18:40"):** Web Programming 1 is both in y2 and y3. I'm glad to see PHP in there.

**[Paul Powell](#30 "2010-03-23 14:40:46"):** I tought I was driving that Prez interface, then realised it was driving itself!!

**[JP](#31 "2010-03-23 14:58:36"):** jQuery rocks. PHP is big, but easy to get to grips with. What approach will be taken to PHP design and development, low-level from framework level (cake, zend etc)?

**[John Kelleher](#32 "2010-03-23 15:04:50"):** Think we need to not just do low-level PHP but also manipulate it from within both CMSs (most CMS use it) and also a PHP framework (like CakePHP CodeIgniter, Zend or Zoop).

**[Colm](#33 "2010-04-16 19:31:29"):** We have CMS so whoever teaches..ooops I mean lectures it can do PHP - it'll be Druple I'd say. Objective C would be nice, and HTML 5 is in but as it's Web Development and Creative Media - need to cater for the creative types. I would expect PHP to be done big time in yr 4. UX is not a subject in the current draft but the areas are covered.

U have shared fabulous Post about Web Development programming.
It offers a nice unique spin on this things.
