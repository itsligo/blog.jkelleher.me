I mentioned [Randy Pausch](http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/) in class today and it seems many haven’t heard of his ‘[last lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo)’. Randy was a professor in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who died in July ‘08 after a fight against pancreatic cancer. It is a tradition at CMU for leaving lecturers to provide a ‘last lecture’ to impart their life lessons. For Randy, this was very much the case. Randy’s lecture has been viewed 10m times and a book is in the works.

The video is a very emphatic affirmation of life and his ambitions and achievements and well worth the viewing.
