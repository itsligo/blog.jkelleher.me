You’re probably familiar with [RapidShare](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/www.rapidshare.com). ![rslogo[1]](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SruSB7l0xlI/AAAAAAAAE7Q/rrybEfidUSA/rslogo%5B1%5D%5B14%5D.gif?imgmax=800)For those not, it’s a no-frills file distribution site. Say, you have large file to hand to someone but no pen drive or the ‘someone’ is remote. You can upload your file to RapidShare and they provide a link to download that file. You can send that link to your friend who can then begin the download remotely.

![rapidshare4](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SruSDQhzM7I/AAAAAAAAE7Y/N8SrOxU1k2Q/rapidshare4_thumb.png?imgmax=800)I used it the other day to upload a file in a hurry. You can see opposite a similar screen to what I got once uploaded. There are two crucial links provided (one to download, the other delete). You need to take careful note of these links since there is no other way to get them back. I duly forwarded the link to my friend but didn’t take note of the _delete_ link. As this was a sensitive document (and unencrypted) I wanted to delete it promptly – no can do – you just wait the 90 days for it to be auto-deleted.

Now having used RapidShare before I knew there was a way to ![rapidshare2](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_-8eBgLSYyzA/SruSFWFoEtI/AAAAAAAAE7g/MGQcYnQeENk/rapidshare2_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800)associate uploads with my free account at RapidShare but as you’ll see, you have to hunt for that logon. This screen zooms in on the innocuous menu across the top where you (or rather, those in the know) can logon to your account.

Once logged in, you will see links to those files you’ve uploaded (and their delete links). It’s a great facility but why not advertise the very useful ‘account’ feature.

Why? It lets me have an account to remind me of the shortened URLs that I make. When I visit, all my shortened URLs are immediately displayed (thanks to [LastPass](http://www.lastpass.com/) auto-logon). Neat.
