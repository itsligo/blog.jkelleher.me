Ordinarily, I’d agree but couple it with seamless deployment (thanks to the App Store) and ease of use (thanks to iPhone), you start to think – hey, I might actually use this.

[RunPee](http://runpee.com/) is (are you sitting down?) a site, but more importantly an iPhone app, that gives you useful time-points in a film where you could take a toilet break without missing anything critical to the plot. Start the app when the movie begins and it’ll vibrate to remind you that the next _n_ minutes would be your window to run pee.

Is that worth $1.99? Doesn’t really matter – what does matter is that such a marginal product as this actually stands a chance of succeeding. Let’s face it: it’s community updated and costs next to nothing to build/deploy (though Apple will take a 30% bit of profits) – so it’d be hard not to make a buck.

The real news though is the ubiquity of a simple ‘common people’ app store coupled with the first usable smart-phone makes an otherwise inconvenient app, a winner (or at least buys the developer beer). The App Store is the living embodiment of [The Long Tail](http://www.thelongtail.com/) (by Chris Anderson) – new tech making it possible to sell niche products to large numbers (even at low cost). And all this not necessarily at the expense of existing popular products selling in large volumes – effectively a new untapped market. Now that’s business.

A few small points: The site is no longer community driven. Me, my wife, mother and sister see all the movies that come out to get peetimes. It would be great if the community could contribute but it's just not that easy to get good and accurate peetimes. In fact it's a pain in the bum. :)

Second, I would agree that this is very much
