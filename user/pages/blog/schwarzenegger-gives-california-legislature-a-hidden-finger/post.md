[Schwarzenegger Gives California Legislature A Hidden Finger](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/4oTAz5xglu0/): "

There is absolutely no way I’ll be able to make this relevant to tech. But I’m posting it anyway. Our Governator, [Arnold Schwarzenegger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger), vetoed a California legislative finance bill – [AB 1176](http://www.totalcapitol.com/?bill_id=9670). The [letter](http://www.totalcapitol.com/?bill_id=9670) is terse and to the point. And the first letter of each line in paragraphs 2-3 are even terser and more to the point.




Schwarzeneggers [battles](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/11/local/me-arnold-budget11) with the state legislature are epic. But this just goes way beyond epic. It’s something for the history books.




I wish I had the time to do this kind of thing in my posts here on TechCrunch.




See the [SF Chronicle](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/28/MNBN1ABKB8.DTL) for all the quotes and denials.




Now, back to our regularly scheduled programing.![](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4oTAz5xglu0)
