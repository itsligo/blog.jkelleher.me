![image](http://www.appsolo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/image.png) Within Microsoft, it’s well acknowledged that Silverlight 3 –> 4 was a big move. Most of what was called for post-SL3 to make SL4 market-ready was delivered. Remember SL3 didn’t even do proper printing so there was a drive to make SL grow up – quickly. Thankfully, there are some good resources to help explore the space. I sometimes forget that Channel 9 do more than just interviews. A good case-in-point is this comprehensive _[training kit](http://channel9.msdn.com/learn/courses/Silverlight4/)_ on SL4, complete with 25 hours of video across 8 targeted modules covering such key areas as RIA, MEF, authentication, _and _printing.
