Matthias showed some fairly well known information visualisation techniques (similar to Hans Rosling’s Gapminder). The talk came alive though with the building out live in Blend 4 beta. Following on earlier talks, the VisualStateManager looks very interesting. Obviously, designers are finding SketchFlow and the built-in animation very engaging – not difficult when you consider they’re currently wrestling with Visio or Photoshop to work up comps – and the interest is rapidly shifting to the transitions between states as much as representation of the states themselves. This is obviously a key feature of Windows Phone 7 series. Matthias says: ‘If you can show it, you should animate it’. Dunno if I totally agree but it’s a road that we haven’t yet embraced so it’s worth following until the designers tell us to stop ;) That said, the easing functions in Blend rock.

A great example was the visualisation of tweets across a Bing map. Matthias animated over time (a short time) the tweets as they appear on the map rather than just have them appear instantly. This creates interest for the user and draws him/her into the interaction, a teaser effectively – and I can see why it works – now. BTW – kudos to the Bing Map guys (who I met earlier this week) – this would be useless unless Bing Maps were as good as it is.

This talk is heavily drawn from an [earlier](http://ignite.oreilly.com/2009/09/matthias-shapiro-on-effective-visualizations.html) talk, so check that out for slides and video. I’ve come across most of the sample visualisation before but it’s nice to see the Silverlight approach or at least be reassured that they can be done using Silverlight. That said, there’s admiration for anyone playing with live code and binding up data without a ‘snippet net’. Matthias believes Flash makes it harder to get at data while Silverlight is better at this.

![Book cover of Beautiful Visualization](http://covers.oreilly.com/images/0636920000617/cat.gif)Good to see Matthias plug Edward Tufte’s books – though, they’re landmark texts, I think there needs to be some tie-in to the ‘how’ rather than just the examples Tufte gives which are rarely IT-related, more typically infographics. ![Book cover of Beautiful Data](http://covers.oreilly.com/images/9780596157128/cat.gif)Visualising Data by [Ben Fry](http://jkelleher.blogspot.com/benfry.com) also came recommended.  [Nathan Yau](http://flowingdata.com/) wrote [Beautiful data](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596157128). Rich Barraza of Cynergysystems.com also mentioned. Joshua Allen & Jon Udell (Descry). Jeff Paries wrote Foundation Silverlight 3 Animation at designwithsilverlight.com. [Beautiful Visualization](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920000617)  by Julie Steel & Noah Rinsky to be launched in April 2010.

## Chris Bernard

![Dynamic Prototyping with SketchFlow in Expression Blend: Sketch Your Ideas...And Bring Them to Life!](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dPNad%2BmtL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)Chris showed some excellent uses for SketchFlow. It seems to scale well but since the speakers (including Chris) were all designers, I got the feeling they felt happy with the power of the tool (albeit from a poor bas alterative) – I wondered how the experience was for the developers. For example, how well could the designers’ animations/styling/gradients/sizing be incorporated into the ‘real’ dev code. I’d like to see some talk on that likely impedance mismatch between the prototype and the transition to dev code. Matthias above worked on real code while SketchFlow seems different – surely the effort invested into SketchFlow can be captured and built-out all within Blend. Are there any losses?

It was good to see this wireframing (or lo-fi prototyping as I prefer to call it) being used in the real world (e.g. with Lowe’s Idylis air purifier site, the Chicago 2016 bid book). Chris has a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Prototyping-SketchFlow-Expression-Ideas/dp/0789742799) where he explores this further.
