A good example of what [Silverlight](http://www.silverlight.net/)/[WPF](http://www.windowsclient.net/) can do. Zurich airport provides this _real-time_ display of air traffic on the apron, taxi-ways and runways. The real app runs on their intranet but you can install an [XBAP version](http://wpf.netfx3.com/direct/zurich/zeuswpf.xbap) locally to play with. [Windowsclient.net](http://windowsclient.net/community/showcasedetails.aspx?p=4272) provides fuller details but essentially the display shows the location, destination and passenger loading for each aircraft about the airport.
