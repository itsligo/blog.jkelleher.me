Ever hovered over a link not sure if it's where you think it is or what kind of link it might be.
Snap is a site that with a click or two provides you with a line of html that when you paste it into a page on your site, provides a useful popup preview of those sites referenced.
There is no perceptible delay in rendering the page as the processing is off-site and the pages are typically cached by snap.com. It scans your web site identifying links and will proactively update its cache with the links on your page.
