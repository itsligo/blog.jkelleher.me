Microsoft launched .NET in 2000 at TechEd Amsterdam. It represented a paradigm shift for the company and followed a major retrenchment re-focusing on the internet which Gates himself admitted as a blunder, a mis-step.

In 2003, we at IT Sligo were looking around for some solutions to the perennial problems – balancing (future) needs of industry (whatever we understood them to be) with the pragmatic nature of teaching. A recurrent theme at the time from students, for example, was the burden of learning multiple languages. Regardless of the arguments for this (aren’t all languages largely equivalent?), not least of which a local demand for specific languages, we saw C# (and .NET) as a reasonable common denominator to hang our new programmes from. Not that a unifying language was the sole determinant of the subsequent changes to our programmes, our decision then to align with MS and .NET, heavily influenced our choices in what followed.

Now, 10 years later it’s worth looking at whether this was a good bet. Though we often talk of the IT industry moving at light speed, paradigm shifts are somewhat tectonic. For example, Object-Oriented languages first appear in 1967 (Simula), but successful penetration of the marketplace began towards the mid-ninties. Similarly, .NET represented such a shift from the top down, it didn’t surprise anyone that even for a goliath like Microsoft, there would be a rocky road to adoption. Java represented an immedate threat to adoption and the rise of the OS (Open-Source) movement another. With similar heavy-weights in the industry (e.g. IBM, Sun Microsystems) making overtures to OS, Microsoft had the most to lose, which accounts for the big spend in .NET.

Looking at the job advertisements currently ([UK data](http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/csharp.do)), C# accounts for 32.5% of all programming jobs (nearest neighbour is Java at 26.4%) climbing 3 places in ranking to no. 5 (Java is at 8). Silverlight is gathering pace too despite still in the early stages of maturing (Microsoft have only recently countenanced comparing it to Adobe Flash), it’s ranked at position 200, rising 531 places since ‘07. Though only commanding 2.8% of app-dev market, Adobe Flash (the incumbent for many years) has a corresponding figure of 7.1% – watch this space.

Another interesting figure is the average salary for these posts (change on last year in parentheses): Silverlight: £45K (+18%), Flash: £32.5K (0%), Java: £47.5K (+11.8%) and C#: £40K (+5.3%). Though Java is performing strongly, the momentum in .NET is evident.

As we gradually move from monolithic applications running client-side, the web is clearly on the ascendancy along with a new bag of problems.

So what does this all mean for future programme development? Just as .NET influenced our positioning over the past decade, where is the common thread that runs through our next move? Or have we identified or acknowledged any thread?

Identifying the next generation of development isn’t just a matter of making a best-guess about the likely success of any one development platform. For a start, it isn’t likely to consolidate around a single class leader. But more importantly, the choices ahead are constrained by cost, our extant in-house skill-sets, carving out a position in the 3rd level marketplace and fit with existing offerings. If you follow the intersection of these ‘lines’, you quickly identify a course of action.

Examining the big new frontiers clearly points to two big prizes: RIAs (Rich Internet Apps) and Mobile. Right now ITS have nothing to offer in these fields. Mobile is the more immature of the two and the more difficult to predict. Apple may have a lead and is closing in on Blackberry’s [market share](http://www.tuaw.com/2009/10/28/apple-iphone-closing-in-on-blackberry-market-share/), though Google’s Android mobile OS is gaining fast (doubling its penetration in the past year) and with its [Nexus One](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2009/tc20091215_283413.htm) smart phone likely to launch in 2010.

Recent [reports](http://www.crn.com/mobile/222002515;jsessionid=2SSUZWMAXOJYDQE1GHPCKH4ATMY32JVN) also predict that shipments of smartphones will outpace sales of notebooks and net books combined in 2010 and outsell all notebook, net book and desktop PCs by 2012. Microsoft are claiming great things for next year’s Windows Mobile 7 – despite being first to market in this area, they’ve dropped the ball. Android could be the dark horse in this race (and with open dev tools should work with .NET in time) but it’s too fragmented to call just yet.

The RIA market is beginning to take form both on the client-side and server-side. However in a market this important and dynamic, there are still many platforms jostling for position. Server side, there’s Rails, Python, Java or ASP.NET. Client-side there are some complementary pairings for these platforms. Right now PHP and Ruby are in fashion (typically with [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) or [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) respectively) or Flash (or Flex & Air) but Microsoft’s offering of Silverlight and/or ASP.NET coupled with sophisticated development tools is a tempting choice. The arguments for/against any of these development platforms are largely redundant – there’s not enough evidence to call it just yet. Most companies will choose according to their in-house skill-sets – and so should we.

While we can probe and investigate what should constitute our best guess for the makeup of the ‘next Level 7/8 programme’, the elephant in the room is the set of constraints within which we’re likely to operate for the foreseeable future. Even setting this aside, the marketplace in which we operate is set to get ever more crowded with bottom-up pressure (from prospective students) to distinguish ourselves and top-down pressure (from HEA et al) to justify our level of investment in particular disciplines. To compete in that frame requires more than just a perfectly worded set of learning objectives….
