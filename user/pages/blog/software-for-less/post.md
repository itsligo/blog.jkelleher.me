![](http://www.software4students.ie/)For those looking for cheaper (rather than dubious free) software, there are two important sources. First, students of IT Sligo are entitled to certain software under the Academic Alliance contract with Microsoft, while you are a student here. Essentially, that's OSs (XP, Vista) and development tools (Visual Studio).
[Software4students](http://www.software4students.ie/) is a site providing a wider range of low-cost full-version software. Your license does not expire on these products. You must register (easy and free) to see the list of software but there are about 30 titles with, for example, Office 2007 for â‚¬78. One caveat, they provide only upgrades to exising OSs so no fresh full version of Vista.
Update 19/9: MS Expression Studio is now available under MSDN AA.

**[JP](#7 "2009-06-17 10:55:02"):** I made the switch to Vista almost immediately and would never look at XP again save for the fact I use it for audio recording (the vista drivers were abit unreliable the last time I tried). Windows 7 is a much improved experience. Pity my desktop kept crashing but that was a simple driver clash. Sat nicely on my laptop though.
