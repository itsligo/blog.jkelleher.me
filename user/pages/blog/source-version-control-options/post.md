![github-logo-transparent](/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/github-logo-transparent.jpg)As we kick off a new development, it's time to reconsider some version control options. Initially, [GIT](https://github.com) or [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com) comes to mind as these are well established and well known. Reasonably priced hosting is now commonplace, even private hosting can be [free](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2378120/is-there-a-free-private-git-repository). However, I've been interested in TFS (Team Foundation Server) from MS for some time. With the imminent launch of VS2012, MS have been offering free, private TFS hosting at [tfspreview.com](http://tfspreview.com). Though this has been invite-only until recently, there are no guarantees around its long-term 'free' price tag. The install is a little easier with the VS2012 line-up but it also works with VS2010 (or even VS2008 with [hotfix](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2673642)) though you'll need VS2010 [SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23691) patch and a [hotfix](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2581206) (no surprises there!). The tfspreview site is slick and it even kick starts VS2012 for you if installed. I haven't found VS2012 Express too stable just yet and will wait for Win8 and VS2012 Ultimate before taking the plunge - new IDE looks good though. ![category-team-foundation-service-200x125](http://www.jkelleher.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/category-team-foundation-service-200x125.png) To use tfspreview.com, you'll need a Windows Live ID to logon and register your Project on the site first. There's a [good walkthrough](https://tfspreview.com/en-us/learn/start/connect-to-vs/) the whole process. For those looking to GIT, there's a good free _and_ private plan available from [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/plans), though I prefer (so far) the integration that TFS offers with VS2010. GIT just isn't as slick to me but we'll see. From what I've seen VS2012's TFS integration looks even better than VS2010 - watch this space. ![mercurial](http://www.jkelleher.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mercurial.png)
