It’s funny how you form an opinion of someone from their writing and then see them ‘in the flesh’ – well, Steve Krug was a surprise. His no-nonsense approach to usability does shine through in this video.

He’s a kind of peoples’ hero of basic usability, the kind that ‘lazy developers’ can tolerate. This isn’t the greatest usability video but it’s a reasonable substitute for not reading his book - ‘Don’t make me think’.
