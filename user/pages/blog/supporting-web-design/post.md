An excellent [post](http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/11/02/6-ways-to-take-your-webdesign-from-good-to-great/) on key aspects of good web design. I particularly liked the discussion on grids and the role they play on virtually all good sites. The author also has a [useful post](http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/02/24/design-a-fresh-blog-theme-on-the-960-grid/) on how to go about setting up a site using a [960 grid](http://960.gs/). Check out the examples given and see how the grid gives the site structure while not restricting creativity.

This is required reading for my HCI students.
