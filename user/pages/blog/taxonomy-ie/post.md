# Taxonomy Ireland

[caption id="attachment_59" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Taxonomy App Screenshot"]![Taxonomy.ie screenshot](http://www.appsolo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/taxonomy_1-300x201.png)[/caption] Taxomony.ie is a NDLR-IT Sligo funded initiative championed by Declan Feeney, Department of Environmental Science. It represents an ambitious collaborative effort to build taxonomies to aid students in the identification of ecological specimens. Initially to be used for documenting waterborne insects from Irish lakes and rivers, the system is being developed to permit others to co-operate in the building of taxonomy keys for other groups as diverse as algae, moths or clouds. Populating of the taxonomy keys will be managed by experts in that genus and students can explore the keys through their browser. The underlying delivery platform is particularly advanced for an application of this nature. The client side (as experienced by users) is driven by Silverlight 4, the latest release which enables rich animated features (to encourage student use), printing ability (to help trace identification), and sophisticated interactive controls to assist in the navigation of the key. Standard web development solutions (such as PHP/CSS) would not be capable of rendering these features to the same extent. At the back-end, we have worked with our hosting service ([Blacknight](http://www.blacknight.ie)) to bring forward their deployment of .NET 4.0 framework which provides for (among other things) our use of RIA Services. RIA Services is Microsoft's leading remote data service framework enabling us to securely and centrally house all application data while delivering it on demand to local users to browse or update.
