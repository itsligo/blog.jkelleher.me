Okay, I’m going out on a limb here, baring all and all that but I have a pet hate – apostrophe abuse. Yes, I even read “[Eats, Shoots & Leaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,_Shoots_&_Leaves)” by Lynn Truss – and enjoyed it. [The OatMeal](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/apostrophe) does a good cartoon to help all you folks out there struggling (yea, I know) with where to put the little fellow. So now there’s help for all those who write “its” and always wondered if you could sneak an apostrophe in there.
