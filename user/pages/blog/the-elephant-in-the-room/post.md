## Nishant Kothary![Profile of Nishant Kothary](http://visitmix.com/images/profiles/illustrations/large/nishkoth.png)

## Sr. Evangelist, MIX Online @rainypixels

Following on a popular talk from MIX09 – A website called Desire – [Nishant](http://visitmix.com/About/nishkoth/?team=true) handles the relaunch of the MIX community online – 8 members on the team. The team host talks, contribute to talks and create software.

“It’s like the Bloods and the Crips – except it’s the Teals and the Dark Charcoal's'” – comparing gang wars to the problems of reaching a consensus on design – everyone’s a designer. Are all stakeholders equal?

He illustrates the ‘getting to know you’ phase of collaborative design to that of comparing music tastes.

Are Stakeholders equal? He tells the SCRUM Chicken and Pig story (‘I’m committed but you’re only involved’).

He reads from [Sway](http://www.swaybook.com/) to illustrate how a fair process of design is perceived by your stakeholders as honest and they feel better for it, regardless of outcome. Creating buy-in from your client matters – make them part of the solution rather than just a critic.

## Controlling the Collaboration

The Solomon Asch Conformity Study (1951) – shows our desire to conform to the group, despite privately disagreeing. The follow-up study showed we’re social creatures not willing to stand out. Designers often ‘fold’ upon client criticism.

Behavioural Economics: Dan Ariely “Predictably Irrational” – study of the human irrationality.

Loss aversion – people prefer to avoid losses than to acquire gains.

Confirmation Bias – tendency for people to prefer information that conforms their preconceptions or hypotheses.

* Don’t act on emotion
* Involve a devil’s advocate
* Stay focused on the big picture
* Be open-minded to trying new things
* Be humble – you’re mortal

## Recap:

* Meeting is not communicating
* Design is not subjective
* fairness matters
* Let experts do their jobs
* Don’t be dogmatic about process or methods
* We must accept our predictably irrational natures.

Underwriting his opines, Nishant refers to a blog post ‘[Web Design from the Gut](http://visitmix.com/Articles/Web-Design-from-the-Gut)’, detailing the process involved in the major redesign of the MIX Online_ site. Somewhat conventional, some parts unconventional, it makes interesting reading and further confirms (okay, I know he would say this as a designer) that wireframing is a key weapon in the design/development arsenal.

Bill Buxton takeaway – be humble, surround yourself with those who plug the gaps in your knowledge and not reflect your brilliance.
