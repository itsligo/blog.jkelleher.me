[UX Booth](http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/the-future-of-interface-design/) showcase what they see as the future for interfaces. I’ve noted a lot of chatter about augmented reality (thanks to Apple’s iPhone). Yes, we’ve got Project Natal, Voice-based interfaces and MS Surface, but the augmented reality is here and I’m sure Google are viewing with great interest.
