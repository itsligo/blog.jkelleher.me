I’ve always enjoyed [Hans Rosling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling)’s talks, most typically at [TED](http://live4.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html), and usually using the Google acquired (2006) G[ap_M_inder](http://www.gapminder.org/). Aside from having a fantastic nordic accent and a slight mad-professor/avuncular character, Rosling is endearing and captivating at the same time as he brings life to the huge quantities of raw that we now possess (or have digitised from the ages).

The objective of the GapMinder foundation is to push the delivery of the [UN Millennium Development Goals](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/) by engaging the audience with a visual message drawn from statistics as broad as CO2 emissions, life expectancy, incomes etc. The brilliance is in the manner of the delivery – [Marshall McLuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message) would be proud – and the way the data’s impact is all the greater thanks to the medium (the visualisation).

It’s hard not to ‘feel’ the impact of AIDS on the world when you see the population figures ‘dip’ as the disease takes hold on Africa – you watch as the circles depicting population both shrink (i.e. deaths) and drop down the Y-axis (lower life expectancy) as the years animate along. Equally impressive is the ‘whip-lash’ affect family planning had in the 60s on (mostly) developing countries, with the exception of some cultures/countries where women’s status didn’t evolve.

You can actually play with GapMinder yourself choosing your time-frame, animation style, the data for your X & Y axis – say plotting income against life expectancy. The data in there stretches back a surprisingly long way.

Incidentally, I came across this in Bill Gate’s new [blog](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Default.aspx) – seems he’s embracing his free time.
