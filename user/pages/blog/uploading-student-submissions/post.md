A common requirement for me is the uploading of student assessments and assignments for evaluation and feedback. For a variety of reasons, this is best handled external to the college and backups pulled to local or cloud repositories. I have used [Jotform](www.jotformpro.com) (or JotFormPro) for a couple years and a short review is warranted. Essentially, JotForm provides a very simple means to create a form to present to participants. Crucially, it allows you to permit file uploads which are then held by JotForm for later review. For important submissions like exams, a useful feature is the mirroring of uploaded files to Google Drive and/or Dropbox. This works generally flawlessly. A confirmation email is forwarded to the participant and the admin. The UI at JotForm isn't perfect and occasionally not intuitive. It actually appears like a Flash application and finding where to change certain settings can be tricky at times.

The free account is reasonable allowing 100 uploads per month with 100mb of storage. This is wiped clean each month and you can of course clear out the submissions when done. It would be nicer to have a little more headroom though. And there you go, a decent offering and once setup will serve you well. Haven't found anything comparable so happy to recommend.
