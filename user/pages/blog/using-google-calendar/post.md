![](http://lh5.google.co.uk/image/jkelleher42/RmfdIa_sKkI/AAAAAAAAAPA/Uv8gUQWPRBU/calendar.jpg)Google calendar has a few tricks that I think make it a good candidate for helping with scheduling assessments/assignments for classes. I've set up an account that we in Dept. Info. Sys. could use to help students and staff keep track of what is due when.
I've created separate coloured calendars for each year. Staff members can use a common login to allow them to add events whenever. You can then provide a link to those students (I have them already on my [site](http://jk.itsligo.ie/WinPrg1/tabid/56/Default.aspx)) taking them to a calendar showing only those events for that year.
I've also added an 'Administration' calendar where notices of events for all groups can be put.
Only staff will be able to add/edit events and the view for students is readonly. It's even possible for students to add their 'class' calendar to their own Google calendar if they have one.
I've put together a short slideshow of how to logon and add an event etc. I also have a simple text file with the URLs for each class calendar for you to put in an email to students or on your own site.
The logon for adding events is jkelleher@itsligo.ie and just [email ](mailto://kelleher.john@itsligo.ie)me for the password. You can logon to Google Calendar [here](http://calendar.google.com/). A list of links to many calendars is shown below. A full list is downloadable from [here](http://jk.itsligo.ie/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=F%2BPvbKLIieY%3D&tabid=105&mid=774&forcedownload=true). To use, just right-click on the link and copy the link location. Then use the URL as the destination to a link you place on your site or in an email to students.
Here a [video ](http://jk.itsligo.ie/Portals/0/articles/google%20calendar.wmv)of how to logon and create an event (4min.)
