Couple it with Win7 and you can really get some work done. Throw in an unhealthy grasp of keyboard [shortcuts](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lisa/archive/2010/04/16/vs-2010-keyboard-shortcut-posters-now-available-for-vb-c-f-c.aspx) and you’re firing on all ![Visual Studio logo](http://i2.visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/content/common/trans.gif)![Visual Studio logo](http://i2.visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/content/common/trans.gif)cylinders. Then if you’re still stalling on real work and want some more turbo-charging, check out the Visual Studio [Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/) of extensions. There’s the handy VS [Color Theme Editor](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/20cd93a2-c435-4d00-a797-499f16402378?SRC=Home) to throw some colour into your editing. I like Noah Richards [ItalicComments](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0b439a8a-e21a-4e26-b82b-054fbf0acab7) which well, do I have to tell you?

And then there’s the heavy duty add-in – [Productivity Power Tools](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef?SRC=Home) by MS. Thankfully, you can turn on/off individual tweaks that are part of this extension. I like Solution Navigator – think of it as like Solution Explorer, on steroids. Don’t forget to use CTRL-W, F to invoke it (sad, isn’t it?). Especially useful is the way you can select parts of your solution (say, the Web project) as ‘root’ and effect all searches against that part alone.

The Quick Access panel (see top of screenshot opposite) behaves like the search box in Blend – great at avoiding the horrible Find panel that seems perpetually to be off-screen. And, CTRL-3 calls up Quick Access!

Other bits – you can now pin particular windows to ensure they stay open. Braces are automatically matched. Tab window behaviour is improved. You can even colour-code tabs according to their Project or even a regex!?

And the piece de resistance – a much improved Add Reference dialog - Life is good. My favourite though is the highlighting of the current line – no more searching for that pesky cursor.

All in all, a useful set of tweaks for a good price – free.
