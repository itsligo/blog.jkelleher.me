Being a Microsoft developer since birth it’s probably about time that I mentioned how to do what we do from another perspective. I’ve been digesting the various .NET libraries that have grown up over the past 7 or more years and seen the tools develop at pace but the job doesn’t seem to have gotten easier – in fact, it can be overwhelming at times. There always seems to be a (supposedly) better way to do everything – every 6 weeks!

On the other side of the fence, folk have begun (probably heavily influenced by cost) to build up very respectable and productive [web frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework). Popular ones like [RubyOnRails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org/) are getting real traction. I see them as a solution for those who don’t want to wrestle with a CMS (like [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/) & [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/)) and plugging all the gaps with 3rd party modules – instead they want a clean, more bespoke solution built on a collection of community tested code – essentially yielding greater control.

![How to Choose a Web Development Framework](http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/510_webFramework/200x200.jpg)[Net-Tuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/tools-of-the-trade-web-development-frameworks-that-the-pros-use/) have a good roundup of current offerings both on the server side and the (small) client side. The latter contains the ubiquitous JQuery – seems Javascipt will never die. [Net-Tuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/15-most-important-considerations-when-choosing-a-web-development-framework/) also have a decent article on considerations around using a framework.
