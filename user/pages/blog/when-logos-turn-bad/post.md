Logos are tricky things. You think you’ve got it nailed and then it bits back big-time. Let the lesson go out…

Of course, the grand-daddy of them all for me is the London Olympics 2012 logo. Designed by the Wolff Olins agency and costing £400,000, many have ridiculed it (25,000 signed an online petitions to scrap it) and some (a not insignificant number) have interpreted it as involved a (how shall I put this) lewd/indiscreet act perpetrated by a one Lisa Simpson. If your mind isn’t as filthy as some (the editor is saying nothing about this!), and you need some mature guidance on what’s you’re looking at, check out [this post](http://www.davidairey.com/london-2012-olympic-logo-disaster/) and read the comments.
