Just when you think you have a great solution that ticks all the boxes like a neat elegant bit of code that covers all the options, then along comes some unexpected side effect that scuppers your innovative efforts.

Take the introduction of LEDs in [traffic lights](http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/16/seville-readies-led-traffic-light-switch/). Apparently the new lamps are _so_ energy efficient that they’d don’t dissipate enough energy by way of heat to melt the snow that builds up on the glass. Accidents are now being attributed to the problem. Can we ever win?
