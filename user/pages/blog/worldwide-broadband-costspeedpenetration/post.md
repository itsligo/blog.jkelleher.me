I’m guessing by now you’ve found lil’ old Ireland. I’d like to say we’re falling behind but then we’d have had to be ahead at some point for that to be true. Seriously, we’re behind countries recently emerged from behind the iron curtain. We’re behind Japan (though so is everyone) that’s just about coming out of a 15 year recession. Okay, we’re ahead of Australia but consider the nightmare problem of reaching the population there given the geographical dispersion of the continent.

Now the other question – just what does Japan do with 61mbps – and that’s only the average!
